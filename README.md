#polls project
####Django poll website

Im new to Django and im practicing with [this tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/intro/tutorial01/)

befor this you need to install python and django. 
then you have to create a new project in terminal using:

`$ django-admin.py startproject mysite`

I used default sqlite db for practicing but if you need to work with something like mysql, i have a blog example [here](https://github.com/niima/mysite)
